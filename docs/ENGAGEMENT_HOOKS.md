# Selection Protocol - Engagement Hooks & Marketing

**Core Principle:** Let them find it organically, but make it shareable when they do.

---

## Social Media Hooks

### The Invitation Format
```
@gamer_pal: play with+against me <stream_url> #killorlay #SelectionProtocol

Translation: "Join me in democratic god-mode - vote to kill or create life, claim lineages"
```

### Hashtag Strategy
- **#killorlay** - The core mechanic (memorable, provocative)
- **#SelectionProtocol** - The project name
- **#TheBibites** - Game community tag
- **#TwitchPlays** - Broader category (for discovery)
- **#ArtificialLife** - Academic/niche audience
- **#EvolutionaryDynamics** - Science-curious viewers

### Tweet Templates

**Discovery Hook:**
```
vote K to kill
vote L to create life
vote X to watch
winner's lineage gets tagged with YOUR username
democracy meets evolution
#killorlay

<stream_url>
```

**Competitive Hook:**
```
my lineage has 47 descendants
yours went extinct in 2 generations
skill issue?

come fight through evolutionary proxy warfare
#killorlay #SelectionProtocol

<stream_url>
```

**Mystery Hook:**
```
what is Selection Protocol?

chat votes every 60 seconds
K (kill) or L (lay) or X (extend)
first L voter claims lineage naming rights
dynasties emerge through democratic evolution

find out: <stream_url>
#killorlay
```

**Stats Hook:**
```
Session 12 results:
- 423 votes cast
- 8 lineages created
- longest dynasty: user_alice (19 generations)
- most descendants: user_bob (73 bibites)
- extinct lineages: 3 (RIP)

your turn: <stream_url>

## Reddit Strategy

### Target Subreddits
- r/TheBibites (primary)
- r/artificallife (niche audience)
- r/CitizenScience (experiment angle)
- r/LivestreamFail (if something hilarious happens)
- r/InternetIsBeautiful (if it goes viral)

### Post Format (r/TheBibites example)
```markdown
Title: "Selection Protocol - Democratic evolution experiment [LIVE]"

Hey bibites community,

I'm running a live experiment called Selection Protocol. Every 60 seconds,
Twitch chat votes on the fate of the current bibite:

- K = Kill
- L = Lay egg (force reproduction)
- X = Extend (keep watching)

The twist: First L voter gets their username tagged to the parent. That tag
inherits to all descendants through the game's built-in system.

So chat is building competing dynasties through evolutionary proxy warfare.

Been running for [N hours], currently [N lineages] active. Completely
autonomous once set up - I just watch the chaos unfold.

Stream: <url>

It's less "Twitch Plays" and more "Twitch Becomes Gods."

#killorlay
```

## Discord/Community Hooks

### Friend Invitation
```
yo check this out - there's a stream where chat votes to kill or reproduce
individual creatures in The Bibites

if you vote to reproduce, YOUR USERNAME gets tagged to that creature's
entire lineage. like you're competing through evolutionary dynasties

been watching for 20 mins, already invested in my lineage lol

<stream_url>
```

### Game Community Message
```
Hey Bibites players,

Running a democracy experiment with the game - Selection Protocol.

Chat votes K/L/X every minute on camera-followed bibites. Winning L voters
claim lineages (username tags inherit to descendants).

Thought the community might find it interesting. It's like natural selection
meets artificial selection meets social dynamics.

<stream_url> if anyone wants to participate or just observe.

## Stream Title Formats

### Standard Format
```
Selection Protocol // Session [N] // [Scenario]
```

### Engagement-Focused Variants
```
Selection Protocol // Your Dynasty Awaits // !vote to play

LIVE: Democratic Evolution // K to kill, L to create life // #killorlay

Selection Protocol S03E12 // 8 Lineages Active // Vote Now

The Bibites: Democracy Mode // Build Your Dynasty Through Evolution
```

---

## Overlay Text Hooks (Rotation)

Display these periodically on the overlay itself:

```
> Vote K to kill, L to reproduce, X to extend
> First L voter claims lineage naming rights
> Your username inherits to all descendants
> Democracy online // Participate now

---

> Selection Protocol: Democratic evolution experiment
> Every 60 seconds, chat decides fate
> Build competing dynasties through votes
> Type k, l, or x in chat

---

> [N] active lineages
> [N] total votes cast this session
> Longest surviving: [username] ([N] generations)
> Type !lineage to check your descendants

---

> Empty chat = natural selection
> One voter = total power
> Democracy at any scale
> You are gods. Choose wisely.
```

## The "What Is This?" Explainer

For confused viewers who wander in:

```
SELECTION PROTOCOL

Every 60 seconds, chat votes:
  K = kill current organism
  L = force reproduction
  X = keep watching

First L voter gets naming rights:
  Your username tags the parent
  Tags inherit to ALL descendants
  Build your dynasty through evolution

One person, one vote
Latest vote replaces previous
Ties open 10s tie-break window

You're not playing a game.
You're competing through evolutionary proxy warfare.

Type k, l, or x to participate.
```

## The Organic Growth Strategy

**Phase 1: Soft Launch**
1. Stream goes live with documentation
2. Post once in r/TheBibites
3. Share with close friends/Discord
4. Let it run overnight
5. See if anyone discovers it

**Phase 2: If Engagement Happens**
1. Start tracking stats (leaderboards)
2. Post weekly results to reddit/twitter
3. Respond to questions in game community
4. Let participants do the marketing (they have lineages invested)

**Phase 3: If It Goes Viral**
1. Keep documentation updated
2. Maintain transparent mechanics
3. Don't change core rules mid-stream
4. Archive interesting moments
5. Consider expanding to other games (future)

## Why This Marketing Approach Works

**It's Not Marketing:**
- You're documenting an experiment
- Sharing results with interested communities
- Inviting participation, not selling entertainment
- Stats and leaderboards are research data, not hype

**Natural Virality Hooks:**
- Personal investment (my lineage!)
- Competitive dynamics (leaderboards)
- Provable outcomes (stats don't lie)
- Shareable moments (epic tie-breaks, dynasties, extinctions)
- Unique concept (hasn't been done before)

**Low Pressure:**
- No content schedule required
- Can run 24/7 autonomously
- Participants market it themselves (show friends their lineages)
- Scientific experiment framing = curiosity-driven discovery

---

## Content You DON'T Need to Create

**No need for:**
- YouTube highlights (just raw VODs if anything)
- TikTok clips
- Produced content
- Personality-driven commentary
- Manufactured drama

**The content IS:**
- The live stream
- The leaderboards
- The stats
- The documentation
- The GitHub repo

**Let the system be the star, not you.**

## The Hook That Works

```
@gamer_pal: play with+against me <stream_url> #killorlay

Translation: "Join a scientific democracy experiment where you build
evolutionary dynasties through collective decision-making"

But that's too many words.

Just: #killorlay
```

**K or L. Life or death. Your choice. Your dynasty.**
